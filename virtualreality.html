              <div class="description">Gift of Life is a non-profit that
                matches bone marrow and stem cell donors to patients with
                blood-borne illnesses like leukemia. aVResis is designed
                for potential donors to better understand the stem cell
                donation process so they'll be more likely to join the
                registry. Users go through a full donation and a roller-
                coaster-like ride through the apheresis machine, including
                the centrifuge and blood-warmer. I modeled and textured the
                apheresis machine, donation chair, and all other furniture
                in Autodesk Maya, put the project together in Unity, and
                used Cinemachine to create a track through the apheresis
                machine. Click to

              <div class="description">Gift of Life is a non-profit that
                matches bone marrow and stem cell donors to patients with
                blood-borne illnesses like leukemia. aVResis is designed
                for potential donors to better understand the stem cell
                donation process so they'll be more likely to join the
                registry. Users go through a full donation and a roller-
                coaster-like ride through the apheresis machine, including
                the centrifuge and blood-warmer. I modeled and textured the
                apheresis machine, donation chair, and all other furniture
                in Autodesk Maya, put the project together in Unity, and
                used Cinemachine to create a track through the apheresis
                machine. Click to

              <div class="description">This project was created over a year
                with three other students. The wizarding world of TAVRN begins
                in our tavern, which serves as the game's main menu. From
                the tavern, users can race through our medieval town on brooms,
                or fight other wizards in our spell duel. TAVRN is now
                available to try on the Oculus store.

                the story of a Japanese drumming group based in San Jose, CA.
                The videos were brought together in unity and made viewable in

                two months with the help of two other students.
